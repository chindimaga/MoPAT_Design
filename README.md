# MoPAT_Design

The work initially started to serve as an additional learning "equipment" to the Robotics Club for swarm robotics and mobile robotics tests.

The system will reduce the whole trouble of tracking and control, an environment where one will just place the robots, use some simple functions to get position and motion data and voila, just implement your algorithm that you have taken so much time to develop.

~~ The work was stalled due to the Covid-19 situation ~~

> With newfound motivation I plan to work on it again

## Work to be done until college reopens -

1. Multi-touch Web UI
2. Multi-TCP server
3. Ideation of the layered control structure
4. NEAT algorithm implementation
5. RFD algorithm implementation
6. Formation control algorithm
7. Motor Schemas based algorithm
8. Robot convex hull generator
9. Static config space generator
10. Multi Robot coordinator
11. Motion Planning algorithms
12. Task Planning algorithms
13. Path Tracking algorithms
